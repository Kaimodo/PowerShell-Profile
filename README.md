My PowerShell Profile (WIP)

This is highly inspired by ([Chris Titus](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech)) and ([Jan de Dobbeleer](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer)).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Profile Script is rudimentary working. But u need to manual download following Files/Folders:

- Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
- Ohmyposhv3-v2.json
- environment.json.sample
- module.json.sample
- "Profile"-Folder

Put all those in your !Profile directory.
Change or copy the .sample files to .json
Change the `SampleMode` Variable in `Environment.json`

> [!NOTE]
> Done things so far:
>
> - [x] The Auto-Import/Install of selected Modules
> - [x] Some critical internal Functions
> - [x] The overall package
> - [x] The Documentation
> - [ ] The Setup-Script

## âš¡ One Line Install (Elevated PowerShell Recommended)

Execute the following command in an elevated PowerShell window to install the PowerShell profile:

Now, enjoy your enhanced and stylish PowerShell experience! ðŸš€
