My PowerShell Profile (WIP)

(The Current Version is just a construct and not meant to be downloaded yet.)

This is highly inspired by ([Chris Titus](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech)) and ([Jan de Dobbeleer](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer)).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Profile Script is rudimentary working. But u need to manual download the Profile-File and the Profile-Folder and put it to the correct place.

---

> [!NOTE]
> I am currently working on te following tasks:
>
> - The Auto-Import/Install of selected Modules
> - Some critical internal Functions
> - The overall package
> - The Documentation
> - The Setup-Script

## âš¡ One Line Install (Elevated PowerShell Recommended)

```bash
