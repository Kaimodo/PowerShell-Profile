My PowerShell Profile (WIP)

(The Current Version is just a construct and not meant to be downloaded yet.)

This is highly inspired by ([Chris Titus](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech)) and ([Jan de Dobbeleer](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer)).

## âš¡ One Line Install (Elevated PowerShell Recommended)

`NOT implemented yet in Version 0.1`

Execute the following command in an elevated PowerShell window to install the PowerShell profile:

```bash
irm "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kaimodo/PowerShell-Profile/main/setup.ps1" | iex
```

Now, enjoy your enhanced and stylish PowerShell experience! ðŸš€
