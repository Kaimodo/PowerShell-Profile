My PowerShell Profile (WIP)

This is highly inspired by ([Chris Titus](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech)) and ([Jan de Dobbeleer](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer)).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Profile Script is working. If Setup.ps1 fails u need to manual download following Files/Folders:

- Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
- "Profile"-Folder

Put both in your !Profile directory.
Change or copy the .sample files to .json
Change the `SampleMode` Variable in `Environment.json`

---

> [!NOTE]
> Done things so far:
>
> - [x] The Auto-Import/Install of selected Modules
> - [x] Some critical internal Functions
> - [x] The overall package
> - [x] The Setup-Script
> - [x] Documentation
